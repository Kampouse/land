<Heading>My first blog: as web rant  ?</Heading>

# the internet is a big place and its crusting?
The year is 2024 and the internet is **rusting**.\
we been able to make stuff happen with someone else's computer \
infratructure and that is pretty cool.\
We been able to make websites and apps and stuff.\
Faster and easier than ever before. \
what the outcome of that? \
Every website is  a _SAAS_ since the last model of being a free \
either the free model of user is the product is no longer profitable \
or simply the new model allow more money to be extracted \
Currently i see the web as a big mall with a lot of shops \
you can find anything you want but you have to pay for it \
but the shops are not the only thing that is selling you stuff \
the mall itself is selling you stuff \
the mall is selling you the idea that you need to buy stuff and the idea that you need to be in the mall
