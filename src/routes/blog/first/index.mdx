<Heading> The "MERN" vibe </Heading>

# I been around the block and its depressing

There are countless nomber of Courses on the the web
effeciently teaching the same thing over over
and over again. I am tired of it. I am tired of it :(

<br />
# Every other youtube tutorial is failing or is outdated Have you ever tried to follow
a tutorial on youtube and every other step is failing. and you spend too long connecting
your database to your server? Do you ever have some cors error because and you cant
figure out a way to fix it? I have been there. Too many times :(.
<br />
# I am tired of the same old same old is there a way out? No? atleast you have to
stop the madness of watching dumb tutorials and start building your own projects.
<br />
# My strategy read the docs, read the docs, read the docs??? more seriously understand
each part of the your stack. What do you mean?? Every time someones ask you why did
you use XYZ you can clearly explain why you used it and not just because some 10
years old stuff online told me to use it.
<br />
# Deploy your junk Deploy your junk. Deploy your junk. Deploy your junk. every time
you build something deploy it. It will help you you might not like it but when someone
asks you what you have built you can show them. Also it will encourage yourself to
build more on it since its already out there. When should you deploy? Now. Now. Now.
Why? imagine you making a car from scartch and you build 99% of it and you try to
start it just to see that it doest start. you will be mad have to go back and unscrew
every other part to see what wrong.Instead you could have build a little something
and test it out. and always have a working version of your "car" or what could become
a "car".
<br />
# But deployement is no free or fun :( its 2024 as for what am writing this there
are coultess platforms that offer a free tier or really cheap
<br />
# Make Readme so people can understand your junk You might not like it but you may
come back to your project after a long time and you will have no idea what you were
doing. So make one so you can get what you were doing and how to get this thing in
development mode.
<br />
# Share your juuk with the world Coding in the vacum is fun you its effectly like
your working in your backyard without anyone knowing or caring about what you are
doing. Share your work with the world. You might get some feedback or you might get
some help. You never know. You might even get a job with it. Who knows.
<br />
# The elephant in the room in the last year i went throught many technologies and
i have to say i learnt nothing but also the were all doing the same thing. You might
choose X or Y but what matter is how well you know x or y and also how much support
both have. You might prefer working with low level primitve like making a webserver
with bun/nodejs with just the barebone api but if you want to ship something you
are on your own when something break;
<br />
TLDR: use something and use it to its full pontential before moving to the next shiny
thing or even just dont move to the next shiny thing :)
